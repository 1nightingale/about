# 1nightingale

Welcome to my digital workshop! I’m the sole nightingale behind this organization—sharing ideas, experiments, and proofs of concept in the hope that they’ll be useful (or at least interesting) to someone out there.

## 🧪 What’s Here?

You’ll find:
- **Personal projects**: My attempts to solve real problems, test new concepts, or occasionally just scratch an itch.
- **Open-source experiments**: Feel free to poke around, use, or adapt anything you find.
- **A few private repos**: Mainly for tinkering with organization runners and CI/CD magic.

## 📂 Featured Repositories

- [ATS Resume Optimiser](https://github.com/1nightingale/ats-resume-optimiser): Helping résumés survive the robot apocalypse. [Blog](https://techntrek.co.uk/article/can-ai-really-help-land-a-job/)
- [Chameleon Contacts](https://github.com/1nightingale/chameleonContacts): Helping résumés survive the robot apocalypse. [Blog](https://techntrek.co.uk/article/decoy-data-part-2/)

## 👐 Licensing

Most projects use a generic open license (MIT, unless otherwise specified—see individual repos for details).

## 🤷‍♂️ Contributors

Currently a solo act, but if you spot something you’d like to improve, pull requests are always welcome.
